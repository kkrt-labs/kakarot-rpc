## Description

Returns the value from a storage position at a given address.

Kakarot specificity: note that Kakarot zkEVM is implemented as a set of Cairo Programs running on an underlying StarknetOS chain (so-called CairoVM chain).

Every deployed EVM smart contract is a Starknet smart contract under the hood. The EVM bytecode of a contract is stored as a Starknet storage variable.

Running the eth_getCode amounts to querying a storage slot in the underlying StarknetOS chain.
