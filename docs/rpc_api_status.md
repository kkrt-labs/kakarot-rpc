[ethereum/execution-apis](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis)

### Method Implementation State

- ‚ùå -> TODO
- ‚úÖ -> Implemented
- üü° -> Does not exactly respect the specification
- ‚ùé -> Unsupported method (e.g. PoW specific methods, deprecated methods, etc.)

### Contribute

The template for the method file can be found
[here](docs/contributing/method_template.md) copy it to the new method file and
edit it corresponding to the method you're implementing. All methods should be
documented in `./methods/{method}.md`
